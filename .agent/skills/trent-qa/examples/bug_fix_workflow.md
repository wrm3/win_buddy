## Phase 4: Investigation (Day 1 - 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM)

### Developer Investigation

**11:00 AM - Reproduction**:
- ✅ Bug reproduced locally
- ✅ Affects all discount codes
- ✅ Pattern identified: shows 5% discount regardless of actual percentage

**11:30 AM - Code Review**:
```javascript
// cart.js line 142 - FOUND THE BUG!
function calculateTotal(subtotal, discountCode) {
  const discount = getDiscountPercentage(discountCode);
  // BUG: Using wrong variable!
  const discountAmount = subtotal * (defaultDiscount / 100);  // ❌ WRONG
  return subtotal - discountAmount;
}
```

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Variable name error: using `defaultDiscount` (5%) instead of `discount` (actual percentage)
- Introduced in commit xyz789 during refactoring
- Code review missed this typo

**12:00 PM - Fix Development**:
```javascript
// FIXED VERSION
function calculateTotal(subtotal, discountCode) {
  const discount = getDiscountPercentage(discountCode);
  const discountAmount = subtotal * (discount / 100);  // ✅ CORRECT
  return subtotal - discountAmount;
}
```

**1:00 PM - Unit Test Created**:
```javascript
test('applies 20% discount correctly', () => {
  const subtotal = 100;
  const discountCode = 'SAVE20';
  const total = calculateTotal(subtotal, discountCode);
  expect(total).toBe(80);  // Should be $80, not $95
});
```

**2:00 PM - Code Review**:
- Fix reviewed by Sarah Chen
- Approved
- Ready for testing

### Status Update

**BUGS.md**:
```markdown
- **Status**: Fixing
- **Root Cause**: Variable name error in cart.js line 142
