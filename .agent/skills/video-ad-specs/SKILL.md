| **A**ction | Last 3-5s | Drive CTA | Clear next step, urgency |

## Hook Techniques (First 3 Seconds)

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bold Question** | "What if your code could review itself?" |
| **Shocking Stat** | "90% of startups fail because of THIS" |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | Unexpected visual or sound |
| **Direct Address** | "Hey developers, stop doing this" |
| **Before/After** | Split screen comparison |

## Caption Requirements

**85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound.** Captions are mandatory.

|----------|--------------|
| TikTok | Built-in auto-captions or burned-in |
| Instagram | Burned-in (auto-captions unreliable) |
| YouTube | Auto-generated + manual review |
| Facebook | Burned-in (sound-off default) |
| LinkedIn | Burned-in (professional context) |
