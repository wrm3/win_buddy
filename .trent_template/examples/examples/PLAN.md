## 4. Phases

### 4.1 Phase Overview

Project work is organized into phases with reserved task ID ranges:

- **Phase 0: Setup & Infrastructure** (Task IDs: 1-99)
  - Environment setup and configuration
  - Initial folder structure creation
  - Status: [ ] Pending

- **Phase 1: Foundation** (Task IDs: 100-199)
  - Core functionality implementation
  - Database schema design
  - Status: [ ] Pending

- **Phase 2: Core Development** (Task IDs: 200-299)
  - Main feature development
  - API implementation
  - Status: [ ] Pending

### 4.2 Phase References
- Phase documents: `.trent/phases/`
- Phase template: `.trent/templates/phase_template.md`

### 4.3 Adding New Phases
- Use `@trent-phase-add` in Cursor
- Phases can be added at any time as project vision clarifies
- Gaps in numbering allowed for pivots

## 5. User experience

### 5.1 Entry points & first-time user flow
**For New Users:**
1. Copy trent template to project
2. Run `@trent-setup` to initialize
3. Create first task using natural language
4. View TASKS.md for task overview

**For Existing Users:**
1. Open project in Cursor
2. Use `@trent-status` for overview
3. Create/update tasks as needed

### 5.2 Core experience
**Creating a Task:**
1. User describes task in natural language
2. fstrent-task-management skill activates
3. Task file created in `.trent/tasks/`
4. TASKS.md updated with new entry

**Tracking Progress:**
1. View TASKS.md for task list
2. Check individual task files for details
3. Update status as work progresses

### 5.3 Advanced features & edge cases
- Sub-task creation for complex work
- Bug tracking with BUGS.md integration
- Phase completion gates with SWOT analysis
- Retroactive task documentation

### 5.4 UI/UX highlights
- Natural language interaction
- Windows-safe emoji indicators
- YAML frontmatter for structure
- Markdown for human readability

## 6. Narrative
A developer starts a new project and copies the trent template. They run `@trent-setup` in Cursor, which creates the folder structure and initial files. When they describe their first feature, the skill creates a task file with proper YAML frontmatter. As they work, they update task status, and TASKS.md reflects current progress with emoji indicators. When a phase completes, they receive a SWOT analysis and commit prompt before moving to the next phase.

## 7. Success metrics

### 7.1 User-centric metrics
- Time to create first task: < 2 minutes
- Task creation success rate: > 95%
- User satisfaction: > 4/5

### 7.2 Business metrics
- Template adoption rate
- Tasks completed per project
- Phase completion rate

### 7.3 Technical metrics
- File format compliance: 100%
- Skill activation accuracy: > 90%
- Zero data corruption incidents

## 8. Technical considerations

### 8.1 Affected subsystems
- **Primary subsystems**:
  - Cursor rules system
  - Skill activation
  - File I/O operations

- **Secondary subsystems**:
  - Git version control
  - Markdown rendering

### 8.2 Integration points
- Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/`)
- Cursor skills (`.cursor/skills/`)
- Cursor commands (`.cursor/commands/`)
- File system for data storage
- Git for version control

### 8.3 Data storage & privacy
