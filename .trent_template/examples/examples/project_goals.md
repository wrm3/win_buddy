## Vision

Build an interactive 3D Silicon Valley office scene where users can explore,
customize their cast of characters, and eventually share or publish their
personalized workspace as a product with tiered feature access.

## Primary Goals

| ID   | Goal                                    | Target / Metric                              | Status   |
|------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| G-01 | Ship a working 3D scene with 5+ characters | All Season 1 cast rendered, animated, and interactive in browser | active |
| G-02 | Enable per-user theme customization      | Users can create, edit, save their own theme  | active   |
| G-03 | Establish monetization foundation        | Stripe billing + tiered theme packs designed  | active   |
| G-04 | Performance: load under 5 seconds        | LCP < 5s on average broadband connection      | active   |

---

## Secondary Goals

Goals that support the primaries but aren't critical path:

- **Voice + Lip Sync**: Characters speak with ElevenLabs TTS and accurate lip sync
- **Mobile Responsive**: Core scene viewable on mobile (no interaction required)
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation for key scene controls
- **Analytics**: Track which characters and scenes users engage with most

---

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

Things we are consciously NOT building right now:

- **Multi-user collaborative scenes** — requires real-time sync infrastructure (post-v1)
- **User-generated characters from scratch** — use predefined cast only (post-v1)
- **Mobile-first interaction** — desktop web is the primary platform for v1
- **Offline/PWA support** — cloud-first; offline is a v2 consideration
- **AI-generated scene backgrounds** — API costs too high for MVP stage

---

## Success Metrics

How we know we've achieved the vision:

- 5+ Silicon Valley cast members rendered with toon shading in browser at < 5s load
- User can create a named theme, edit it, save it, and reload it from their account
- Stripe checkout flow works end-to-end for a $35 starter pack purchase
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in auth/storage layer
- 10+ beta users have created custom themes without bug reports
