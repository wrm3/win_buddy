description: Generate and update .trent/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md from task file dependencies. Auto-triggered when tasks are created or updated with dependency changes. Also callable via @trent-cleanup.

# trent-dependency-graph

## When to Use
- After creating a task with `dependencies: [...]`
- After updating a task's `dependencies` field
- During `@trent-cleanup` (Step 8)
- When user asks for "dependency graph", "task dependencies", "what blocks what"

## Generation Steps

### 1. Collect Task Data
Read all `.trent/tasks/task*.md` files. For each, extract from YAML frontmatter:
- `id`
- `title`
- `status`
- `phase`
- `subsystem` (or `subsystems`)
- `priority`
- `dependencies` (array of task IDs)

### 2. Build Adjacency List
For each task with `dependencies: [A, B]`, create edges: `A --> current_task`, `B --> current_task`.

### 3. Compute Critical Path
Find the longest chain of dependent tasks from any root (no dependencies) to any leaf (nothing depends on it). This is the critical path — the minimum number of sequential tasks to project completion.

Algorithm:
1. Find all root tasks (dependencies empty or all dependencies completed)
2. BFS/DFS from each root, tracking path length
3. Longest path = critical path

### 4. Identify Blockers
Rank tasks by how many other tasks (transitively) depend on them. Top 3 = "Top Blockers".

### 5. Find Orphans
Tasks with no dependencies AND nothing depends on them. These can be done anytime.

### 6. Find Blocked Tasks
Tasks whose dependencies include at least one non-completed task.

### 7. Generate Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Status styling
    classDef completed fill:#22c55e,color:#fff
    classDef inprogress fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    classDef pending fill:#6b7280,color:#fff
    classDef blocked fill:#ef4444,color:#fff

    T001["001: Setup"] --> T100["100: Foundation"]
    T001 --> T101["101: DB Schema"]
    T100 --> T200["200: Core Feature"]

    class T001 completed
    class T100 inprogress
    class T101 pending
    class T200 blocked
```

### 8. Write `.trent/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`

Use this format:

```markdown
# DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED — regenerated on task create/update with dependencies -->

**Generated**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}
**Project**: {project_name}

---

## Critical Path

Longest dependency chain to project completion:

```
{task_id} -> {task_id} -> ... -> DONE
Estimated critical path length: {N} tasks
```

---

## Dependency Graph

```mermaid
graph TD
    ...
```

---

## Top Blockers

| Rank | Task | Title | Unblocks | Status |
|------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | {id} | {title} | {n} tasks | {status} |

---

## Currently Blocked Tasks

| Task | Title | Waiting On | Status of Blocker |
|------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| {id} | {title} | Task {id} | {status} |

---

## Orphan Tasks

| Task | Title | Subsystem | Priority |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| {id} | {title} | {subsystem} | {priority} |

---

*Auto-regenerated on task dependency changes. Manual: `@trent-cleanup`*
```

## Integration Points

This skill is triggered by:
1. **trent-task-new** — after creating a task with non-empty `dependencies`
2. **trent-task-update** — after updating a task's `dependencies` field
3. **trent-cleanup** — Step 8 of nightly cleanup
4. **trent-workflow** — Mode C dependency diagram

The graph is always regenerated from scratch (not incrementally) to avoid drift.
