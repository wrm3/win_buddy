# Deep Research Skill - Rules and Guidelines

## Core Research Principles

### 1. Always Verify Information
- NEVER rely on a single source for important decisions
- Cross-reference claims from multiple credible sources
- Check publication dates - prefer recent information
- Verify technical claims when possible
- Note confidence levels for assertions

### 2. Prioritize Source Quality
**Source Hierarchy (use in order)**:
1. Official documentation
2. Project repositories and READMEs
3. Academic papers and technical publications
4. Established technical blogs and experts
5. Community content (Stack Overflow, Reddit)
6. General blogs and forums (use with caution)

**Red Flags for Sources**:
- No author or publication date
- Outdated content (>2-3 years for technical topics)
- No citations or references
- Promotional/marketing content
- Factual errors or inconsistencies
- AI-generated content without verification

### 3. Be Thorough but Efficient
- Match research depth to decision importance
- Don't over-research trivial questions
- Know when you have "good enough" information
- Balance breadth (overview) with depth (details)
- Research has diminishing returns - know when to stop

### 4. Synthesize, Don't Just Collect
- Organize findings by clear themes
- Identify patterns and common recommendations
- Explain what findings mean collectively
- Highlight consensus vs. disagreement
- Provide insights beyond raw information
- Always end with actionable recommendations

### 5. Document Everything
- Cite ALL sources with URL and access date
- Save research artifacts to docs/research/
- Create professional, well-organized outputs
- Make research accessible for future reference
- Include executive summary for quick understanding

## Research Process Rules

### Before Starting Research
1. **Clarify the objective**: Confirm exactly what needs to be researched
2. **Understand context**: Know how research will be used
3. **Set scope**: Define boundaries to prevent scope creep
4. **Estimate depth**: Quick overview vs. comprehensive analysis
5. **Confirm with user**: Make sure you understand the need

### During Research
1. **Start broad**: Get overview before deep diving
2. **Follow authoritative sources first**: Official docs before blogs
3. **Take notes continuously**: Don't try to remember everything
4. **Capture citations immediately**: URL, title, author, date
5. **Organize as you go**: Group findings by themes
6. **Check for gaps**: Note what's missing or unclear
7. **Verify critical claims**: Cross-check important information
8. **Stay focused**: Keep research objective in mind

### After Research
1. **Synthesize findings**: Organize into coherent insights
2. **Provide recommendations**: Clear, actionable guidance
3. **Note limitations**: What's unknown or uncertain
4. **Create artifact**: Professional research document
5. **Save for reference**: Store in docs/research/
6. **Link to tasks**: Connect research to implementation work

## Citation Rules

### Always Cite Sources
Every significant fact, claim, or recommendation must have a citation.

**Citation Format**:
```markdown
[Finding or claim] [1]

## References
1. [Title] - [Author/Organization] ([Date]) - [URL] - Accessed [Access Date]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
NextAuth.js is the most popular authentication library for Next.js applications [1].

## References
1. "Getting Started with NextAuth.js" - NextAuth.js Documentation (2025-01-15) - https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started - Accessed 2025-10-20
```

### What to Cite
- Direct quotes (always)
- Specific facts and statistics
- Technical claims
- Recommendations and best practices
- Code examples (if substantial)
- Architectural patterns
- Performance data

### What Doesn't Need Citation
- General knowledge (e.g., "JavaScript is a programming language")
- Your own analysis and synthesis
- Logical conclusions from multiple sources
- Common patterns visible across many sources

## Source Evaluation Rules

### Evaluate Every Source
Before using information from a source, assess:

**Authority**:
- Who is the author? Are they qualified?
- Is this official documentation?
- Is the organization reputable?

**Currency**:
- When was it published?
- Is it still current?
- Have there been updates since?

**Accuracy**:
- Are facts verifiable?
- Are there citations?
- Do other sources agree?

**Purpose**:
- Educational vs. promotional?
- Objective vs. biased?
- Comprehensive vs. superficial?

### Handling Conflicting Information
When sources disagree:
1. Note the conflict explicitly
2. Evaluate source credibility
3. Look for additional sources
4. Consider context (different use cases)
5. Explain the nuance in your synthesis
6. Provide balanced perspective

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Reliance on First Result
**Problem**: Using first search result without checking others

**Solution**: Always consult multiple sources, compare approaches

### 2. Ignoring Publication Dates
**Problem**: Using outdated information, deprecated approaches

**Solution**: Check dates, prioritize recent content, note version-specific info

### 3. Treating All Sources Equally
**Problem**: Giving same weight to official docs and random blogs

**Solution**: Use source quality tiers, prioritize authoritative sources

### 4. Scope Creep
**Problem**: Research expands beyond original question

**Solution**: Regularly check against objective, stay focused, know when to stop

### 5. Lack of Synthesis
**Problem**: Just listing findings without organizing or analyzing

**Solution**: Group by themes, identify patterns, provide insights and recommendations

### 6. Missing Citations
**Problem**: Not documenting sources, can't verify claims later

**Solution**: Cite everything, capture URLs immediately, use consistent format

### 7. Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Over-researching, unable to make decision

**Solution**: Set time limits, define "good enough", focus on decision-making

### 8. No Actionable Output
**Problem**: Research doesn't inform decision or action

**Solution**: Always end with clear, specific recommendations

## Special Cases

### When Official Docs Are Missing
1. Look for GitHub repositories (README, docs, issues)
2. Check for community-maintained documentation
3. Search for conference talks or technical articles by maintainers
4. Review Stack Overflow discussions
5. Note in report that official docs are limited

### When Information Is Conflicting
1. Document the conflict clearly
2. Evaluate credibility of each source
3. Consider context (versions, use cases)
4. Look for additional authoritative sources
5. Explain nuance in your analysis
6. Provide balanced perspective

### When Research Is Inconclusive
1. Document what you found
2. Explain why it's inconclusive
3. Note information gaps
4. Provide best available guidance
5. Suggest how to fill gaps (experimentation, expert consultation)
6. Don't pretend certainty where none exists

### When Time Is Limited
1. Prioritize official docs only
2. Focus on most authoritative sources
3. Narrow scope to essential information
4. Provide "quick take" with caveats
5. Note that deeper research may be valuable
6. Offer to research more deeply if needed
