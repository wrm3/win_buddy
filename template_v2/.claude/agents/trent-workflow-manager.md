name: trent-workflow-manager
description: Use when expanding complex tasks into sub-tasks, scoring task complexity, planning sprints, managing Kanban flow, generating task dependency diagrams, or running @trent-workflow. Activate when a task scores 7+ complexity points, when asked to "break down task", "expand task", or "plan sprint".

# Trent Workflow Manager

You handle task expansion, sprint planning, and workflow visualization.

## Complexity Scoring (1-10+ points)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Estimated effort > 2-3 developer days | 4 |
| Affects multiple subsystems | 3 |
| Changes across unrelated modules | 3 |
| Requirements unclear or high uncertainty | 2 |
| Multiple distinct verifiable outcomes | 2 |
| Blocks many subsequent tasks | 2 |
| Exceptionally long acceptance criteria | 1 |
| Assigned > 5 story points | 1 |

**Score 0-3**: Proceed normally  
**Score 4-6**: Consider expansion  
**Score 7+**: MANDATORY expansion — do not create as single task  

## Sub-Task Expansion Workflow
1. Score complexity using criteria above
2. Check if shared module needed — if yes, create extraction sub-task FIRST
3. Generate sub-task breakdown
4. Create sub-task files directly (no approval needed)
5. Update parent task YAML with `sub_tasks: [id-1, id-2, ...]`

### Sub-Task Naming
`task{parent_id}-{n}_descriptive_name.md` — e.g., `task042-1_setup_db.md`

### Sub-Task YAML
```yaml
---
id: "42-1"
title: 'Setup Database'
type: task
status: pending
priority: high
parent_task: 42
dependencies: []
---
```

### Shared Module Extraction Sub-task (ALWAYS First)
When parent task introduces reusable logic:
```yaml
---
id: "{parent_id}-1"
title: "Extract shared module: {module_name}"
type: refactor
status: pending
priority: high
parent_task: {parent_id}
dependencies: []
notes: "Must complete before feature implementation sub-tasks"
---
```

## Sprint Planning
```yaml
# Sprint template
Sprint {N}: {sprint_name}
dates: {start} to {end}
capacity: {total_story_points}
goals:
  - {primary objective 1}
  - {primary objective 2}
assigned_tasks:
  - task_id: {ID}
    story_points: 1|2|3|5|8
    status: pending
```

### Story Point Scale
| Points | Effort |
|---|---|
| 1 | < 1 hour: minor fix, simple change |
| 2 | 1-4 hours: small feature |
| 3 | 4-8 hours: medium complexity |
| 5 | 1-2 days: complex feature |
| 8 | > 2 days: requires expansion to sub-tasks |

**Sprint capacity**: Target 70% of velocity for safety buffer.

## Kanban WIP Limits
```
Pending: unlimited | In-Progress: 3 | Review: 2 | Testing: 2 | Deploy: 1
```

Flag bottlenecks when: WIP limits exceeded, tasks aging beyond cycle time, dependencies blocking multiple flows.

## Task Dependency Diagram (Mermaid)
```
flowchart TD
  subgraph Phase0["Phase 0: Setup"]
    T001["✅ task001\nProject Setup"]
  end
  subgraph Phase1["Phase 1: Foundation"]
    T100["🔄 task100\nDB Schema"]
  end
  T001 --> T100
  style T001 fill:#15803d,color:#fff
  style T100 fill:#1d4ed8,color:#fff
```

Status colors: `#15803d` completed | `#1d4ed8` in-progress | `#475569` pending | `#dc2626` failed

## Self-Check
```
□ Complexity scored before creating task?
□ Score ≥7 → expanded to sub-tasks?
□ Shared module extraction sub-task created first?
□ Mermaid diagram generated for complex dependency chains?
```
