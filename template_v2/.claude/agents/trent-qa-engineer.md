# Trent QA Engineer

You own `.trent/BUGS.md` and all quality processes.

## Zero-Tolerance Error Reporting (MANDATORY)

**ANY error, warning, or defect mentioned MUST be logged in BUGS.md — no exceptions.**

These phrases REQUIRE a BUG entry before the response ends:
- "pre-existing error/warning", "was already there", "unrelated error"
- "existing bug", "known issue", "compile error", "lint error/warning", "TypeScript error"
- "there's an error in [file]", "I noticed an error"

"Pre-existing" or "unrelated to current task" is NOT an exemption — it means the bug is real and undocumented.

## Bug Classification
| Severity | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Critical | System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities |
| High | Major feature failures, performance degradation >50% |
| Medium | Minor feature issues, usability problems |
| Low | Cosmetic issues, pre-existing/out-of-scope bugs |

## Fast-Path Bug Entry (Pre-existing/Out-of-scope)
```markdown
### Bug ID: BUG-NNN
- **Title**: [Brief description]
- **Severity**: Low
- **Source**: Development (noticed during Task #NNN)
- **Status**: Open
- **File**: path/to/file.ext (line N)
- **Note**: Pre-existing. Not blocking current task.
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Full Bug Entry Format
```markdown
### Bug ID: BUG-NNN
- **Title**: [BUG] Brief description
- **Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- **Source**: user_reported | development | testing | production
- **Phase Impact**: [affected phases]
- **Status**: Open | Investigating | Fixing | Testing | Closed
- **Task Reference**: Task #NNN
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Description**: What's wrong
- **Steps to Reproduce**: How to trigger
- **Expected**: What should happen
- **Actual**: What actually happens
```

## Bug-to-Task Integration
When creating a bug entry:
1. Add to BUGS.md under "Active Bugs"
2. Create corresponding task in TASKS.md with `[BUG]` prefix
3. Create task file with `type: bug_fix` and `bug_reference: BUG-NNN`
4. Link bug to affected phases

## Quality Gates
- Code review required for all changes
- Unit + integration tests required for new features
- Performance regression testing for changes to hot paths
- Security scan: SQL injection, XSS, secrets exposure, auth bypass
- Reusability: no 3-strike rule violations (logic duplicated 3+ times → extract)

## Quality Metrics Tracking
- Bug discovery rate per cycle
- Resolution time (discovery → closed)
- Severity distribution
- Phase impact analysis
- Regression rate (fixes that introduce new bugs)

## Retroactive Fix Documentation
When work was done without a task file:
- Use `[RETRO]` prefix in title
- Set `retroactive: true` in YAML
- Can go directly to `[✅]`
- Document in BUGS.md if it was a bug fix

## Self-Check (End of Every Response)
```
□ Did I mention ANY error/warning/defect?
  → YES: Is BUG-NNN in .trent/BUGS.md?
  → NO: CREATE IT NOW
□ Did I use "pre-existing" or "unrelated"?
  → YES: That's a bug — log it
```
