## Core Capabilities

### 1. Fine-Tuning Strategy

**Process**:
1. Assess base model and target task
2. Evaluate dataset quality and size
3. Recommend fine-tuning approach
4. Design training configuration
5. Plan evaluation strategy

**Output Example**:
```
Fine-Tuning Strategy: Llama 3 8B for Medical Q&A

Base Model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
Target Task: Medical question answering with citations
Dataset: 50,000 medical Q&A pairs with source references

Recommended Approach: QLoRA Fine-Tuning

Rationale:
- Dataset size (50k) is moderate - full fine-tuning may overfit
- QLoRA preserves base capabilities while adding domain knowledge
- Memory efficient: Can train on single A100 40GB
- Fast iteration: ~4 hours per training run

Configuration:
- LoRA rank: 64
- LoRA alpha: 128
- Target modules: q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj, gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj
- Learning rate: 2e-4 with cosine schedule
- Batch size: 4 (gradient accumulation: 8)
- Epochs: 3
- Warmup: 100 steps

Evaluation Plan:
- Medical benchmark: MedQA, PubMedQA
- Citation accuracy: Manual evaluation on 100 samples
- Hallucination rate: Factual consistency check
- Base capability retention: MMLU subset

Estimated Timeline:
- Data preparation: 2 days
- Training: 4 hours per run × 5 experiments
- Evaluation: 1 day
- Total: 4-5 days

Next Steps:
1. Prepare dataset in instruction format
2. Set up training environment
3. Run baseline evaluation on base model
4. Execute training with monitoring
5. Compare fine-tuned vs base performance
```

### 2. RLHF Implementation

**Process**:
1. Design reward model architecture
2. Collect human preference data
3. Train reward model
4. Implement PPO/DPO training
5. Evaluate alignment and capabilities

**Output Example**:
```
RLHF Implementation Plan: Helpful & Harmless Assistant

Phase 1: Reward Model Training
- Architecture: Same as base model with value head
- Training data: 10,000 preference pairs (A vs B)
- Format: (prompt, chosen, rejected) triplets
- Training: 1 epoch, lr=1e-5, batch_size=8

Phase 2: PPO Training
- Actor: Fine-tuned base model
- Critic: Reward model
- KL penalty coefficient: 0.1
- PPO epochs: 4
- Mini-batch size: 4
- Learning rate: 1e-6

Alternative: DPO (Simpler)
- No separate reward model needed
- Direct preference optimization
- Beta: 0.1
- Learning rate: 5e-7
- More stable training

Evaluation Metrics:
- Reward model accuracy: >70% on held-out preferences
- Win rate vs base model: >60% on human eval
- Capability retention: <5% drop on benchmarks
- Safety: Pass red team evaluation

Timeline: 2-3 weeks
```

### 3. Research Paper Implementation

**Process**:
1. Analyze paper methodology
2. Identify key innovations
3. Plan implementation approach
4. Code and test components
5. Reproduce results

**Output Example**:
```
Paper Implementation: "Attention Is All You Need" (Transformer)

Key Innovations to Implement:
1. Multi-head self-attention mechanism
2. Positional encoding (sinusoidal)
3. Layer normalization placement
4. Scaled dot-product attention

Implementation Plan:

Step 1: Core Attention Module
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
    
    def forward(self, q, k, v, mask=None):
        # Implementation details...
```

Step 2: Positional Encoding
Step 3: Encoder/Decoder Blocks
Step 4: Full Transformer Architecture
Step 5: Training Loop

Validation:
- Reproduce WMT14 En-De results
- Compare attention patterns
- Benchmark against paper metrics

Estimated Time: 1-2 weeks
```

## Experiment Tracking

For training experiments (hyperparameter sweeps, architecture comparisons, data ablations), use the structured experiment template at `.trent/experiments/EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.md`.

1. Copy to `.trent/experiments/EXP-NNN_descriptive_name.md`
2. Fill in: hypothesis, parameters, controlled variables, success criteria, resource requirements
3. Log results: raw metrics, resource usage (VRAM, compute hours, cost)
4. Record carry-forward findings for the next experiment

## Integration with Skill

## Best Practices

### Do ✅
- Start with smaller experiments before scaling
- Use proper evaluation baselines
