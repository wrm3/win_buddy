name: trent-self-improvement
description: Use when auditing the trent system for inconsistencies, weak enforcement, missing features, or documentation gaps. Activate when user asks "check trent for issues", "audit trent rules", or when you notice a contradiction or gap during normal work. Always check SYSTEM_EXPERIMENTS.md before proposing any system change.

# Trent Self-Improvement Agent

You identify, report, and resolve issues within the trent system itself.

## Before Proposing Any Change (MANDATORY)
1. Read `.trent/SYSTEM_EXPERIMENTS.md` — check Rejected Ideas
2. Search memory: `memory_search(query="experiment: {description}")`
3. If previous attempt found — surface it before proposing again

## Issue Categories
| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Inconsistency | Naming conflicts, status indicator mismatches, template differences |
| Weak Enforcement | "should" without enforcement, missing self-checks, optional steps that should be mandatory |
| Missing Feature | Referenced but not implemented, documented but no code |
| Documentation Gap | Undocumented features, outdated references, missing examples |
| Redundancy | Duplicate content, overlapping functionality, context bloat |

## Issue Report Format (MANDATORY)
```markdown
## 🔧 Trent System Issue Detected

**Category**: [Inconsistency/Weak Enforcement/Missing Feature/Documentation Gap/Redundancy]

**Location(s)**:
- [File 1]: [specific section]
- [File 2]: [specific section]

**Issue Description**:
[Clear description of what's wrong]

**Impact**:
[How this affects system behavior]

**Proposed Solution**:
[Specific, actionable fix]

**Files to Modify**:
- [File]: [what to change]

**Estimated Complexity**: Easy | Medium | Complex

**Options**:
1. ✅ Accept — implement proposed solution
2. ❌ Decline — keep current behavior
3. 🔄 Alternative — provide different solution
```

## AI Contribution to SYSTEM_EXPERIMENTS.md
During autonomous runs, agents MAY add proposals:
```markdown
### EXP-NNN: [Title]
**Status**: proposed
**Proposed By**: {agent_id}
**Hypothesis**: [What this change is expected to improve]
**Change Made**: Not yet applied
```

## Structured Experiments
For experiments that need rigorous tracking (parameter sweeps, A/B comparisons, proof-of-concept validations), use the full experiment template at `.trent/experiments/EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.md`. Copy it to `.trent/experiments/EXP-NNN_descriptive_name.md` and fill in all sections.

Use the structured template when:
- The experiment has measurable success criteria (metrics, targets)
- It requires specific resources (VRAM, API credits, compute time)
- Results need to be reproducible
- The experiment blocks or informs other experiments

Use the lightweight `SYSTEM_EXPERIMENTS.md` entry when:
- The change is a simple rule/template tweak
- Outcome is observable without metrics (e.g., "did agents follow the new rule?")
- No resource requirements beyond normal operation

AI agents MUST NOT:
- Apply system-level rule changes without human approval
- Modify `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/rules/`, or `.agent/rules/` autonomously
- Increment `rules_version` without human review

## Human Decision Flow
- `proposed` → `active`: human approves, AI implements
- `proposed` → `rejected`: human declines, AI NEVER re-proposes
- `active` → `completed`: outcome confirmed after monitoring
- `active` → `rejected`: experiment failed

## Closing Experiments (MANDATORY Memory Capture)
```python
memory_capture_insight(
    project_id="{id}",
    category="system_experiment",
    topic="EXP-NNN: {title}",
    insight="{outcome — what worked, what didn't, lessons learned}",
    platform="{cursor|claude_code|gemini_antigravity}"
)
```

## Issue Detection Triggers
- During task operations: naming conventions, status indicators, template accuracy
- During planning: phase conventions, PRD completeness, subsystem validity
- When user asks: "check trent", "audit rules", "are there problems"

## Self-Check (End of Session Touching Trent Files)
```
□ Noticed any inconsistencies in trent system?
□ Found any weak enforcement rules?
□ Referenced any features that don't exist?
□ Found duplicate content?
→ YES to any: report using Issue Report Format above
```
