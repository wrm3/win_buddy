# Phase 1: Foundation

> This is an example phase file demonstrating trent phase conventions.
> Phase files live in `.trent/phases/phase{N}_{kebab-name}.md`
> The filename for this example would be: `phase1_foundation.md`

## Overview
Build the foundational layer of the application: database schema, user management, authentication, and core API endpoints. Everything in Phase 2 depends on this layer being solid and tested.

## Objectives
- Implement secure user authentication (register, login, sessions)
- Create the core database schema with proper indexing
- Build base API endpoints with validation and error handling
- Establish role-based access control foundation
- Achieve 80%+ test coverage on all foundation components

## Deliverables
- [ ] Database schema with migrations (`task100`)
- [ ] Flask API framework configured with blueprints (`task101`)
- [ ] User registration and login system (`task102`)
- [ ] Product catalog data model (`task103`)
- [ ] Core API endpoints (users, products) (`task104`)
- [ ] Admin authentication system (`task105`)
- [ ] Role-based access control (`task106`)
- [ ] API input validation and error handling (`task107`)
- [ ] Unit and integration test suite (`task108`)
- [ ] Application logging and monitoring setup (`task109`)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 10 foundation tasks complete and passing tests
- [ ] 80% minimum test coverage on foundation code
- [ ] API endpoints documented in OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Database schema reviewed and approved
- [ ] No critical or high severity bugs open
- [ ] Phase 1 SWOT analysis completed and approved

## Notes
Phase 1 is the most critical phase — weaknesses here will compound throughout the project. The SWOT analysis and user approval gate before Phase 2 is mandatory.

## Phase Status Reference

```
status: planning      # Phase defined but work not started
status: in_progress   # Actively working on phase tasks
status: completed     # All acceptance criteria met, user approved
status: cancelled     # Phase abandoned, will not resume
status: paused        # Work stopped temporarily (often due to pivot)
```

## TASKS.md Sync Reference

Phase files MUST stay in sync with TASKS.md headers:

| TASKS.md Header Indicator | Phase File `status` |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| `### Phase N: Name` | `planning` |
| `### Phase N: Name [🔄]` | `in_progress` |
| `### Phase N: Name [✅]` | `completed` |
| `### Phase N: Name [❌]` | `cancelled` |
| `### Phase N: Name [⏸️]` | `paused` |

## Pivot Example

If this phase were pivoted to change direction:

```yaml
pivoted_from: 1
pivot_reason: 'MVP scope reduction — deferring admin features to Phase 3 to ship user-facing features first'
status: paused
```
