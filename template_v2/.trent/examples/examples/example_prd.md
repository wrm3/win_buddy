# PRD: Task Management Web Application

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Document Title and Version
- PRD: Task Management Web Application
- Version: 1.0
- Created: 2026-01-15

### 1.2 Product Summary

A web-based task management application designed for small teams (2-10 users) to organize, track, and collaborate on projects. The application provides a simple, intuitive interface for creating tasks, assigning them to team members, tracking progress, and managing deadlines. Built with React frontend and Python/Flask backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

The application focuses on simplicity and ease of use, avoiding complex project management overhead in favor of core task tracking that teams can adopt immediately without extensive training.

## 3. User Personas

### 3.1 Key User Types
- Team members (individual contributors)
- Team leads (task creators and work coordinators)
- Project managers (progress viewers and reporters)

### 3.2 Basic Persona Details
- **Team Member (Maya)**: Individual contributor who creates personal tasks and updates status on tasks assigned to her. Values speed — wants to log work and move on.
- **Team Lead (Carlos)**: Creates tasks for the sprint, assigns to team members, and checks daily progress. Needs clear overview of who is working on what.
- **Project Manager (Priya)**: Monitors overall project status and produces weekly status reports. Rarely creates tasks — primarily a read-only viewer.

### 3.3 Role-Based Access
- **Team Member**: Create own tasks, view assigned tasks, update own task status
- **Team Lead**: All team member permissions + create tasks for others, view all team tasks, reassign tasks
- **Project Manager**: Read-only access to all tasks, export reports

## 4. Phases

### 4.1 Phase Overview

| Phase | Tasks | Focus | Duration |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 0: Setup | 1-99 | Project structure, CI/CD, database setup | 1 week |
| Phase 1: Foundation | 100-199 | Auth, user mgmt, core API, data models | 2 weeks |
| Phase 2: Core Features | 200-299 | Task CRUD, assignment, status UI | 3 weeks |
| Phase 3: Enhancement | 300-399 | Search, filtering, reporting, polish | 2 weeks |

### 4.2 Phase Files

## 5. User Experience

### 5.1 Entry Points and First-Time User Flow
- Navigate to application URL
- Login page (email/password)
- First-time users see a brief onboarding screen (3 steps, skippable)
- After login: dashboard showing assigned tasks and upcoming deadlines

### 5.2 Core Experience
- **Dashboard**: Overview of assigned tasks, recent activity, tasks due today
- **Task List**: Filterable/sortable list of tasks (mine, assigned by me, all team)
- **Task Creation**: Simple form — title, description, assignee, priority, due date
- **Task Detail**: View full details, update status, leave comments, view history
- **Task Board**: Kanban-style view (Pending / In Progress / Done columns)

### 5.3 Advanced Features and Edge Cases
- Bulk task operations (mark multiple as complete)
- Task templates for recurring work
- CSV export of task history
- Task archiving for completed projects

### 5.4 UI/UX Highlights
- Clean, minimal design (Todoist-inspired)
- Responsive layout (desktop + tablet priority, mobile functional)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (N = new task, / = search)
- Color-coded priority levels (Critical=red, High=orange, Medium=blue, Low=gray)

## 6. Narrative

Carlos starts his Monday by opening the task board to review the sprint. He creates three new tasks for the week's goals, assigns two to Maya and one to himself, and sets due dates. Throughout the day, Maya updates her task statuses as she makes progress, and Carlos can see the board changing in real-time. On Friday, Priya logs in to review the week's completed work and generates a brief status report for leadership — all from the same simple interface that the team uses daily. Nobody needed training, nothing fell through the cracks.

## 7. Success Metrics

### 7.1 User-Centric Metrics
- Task completion rate: > 80% of tasks completed by their due date
- User adoption: 90% of team actively using the tool within 2 weeks of launch
- Tasks created per user per week: 5-10 (indicates active use)
- User satisfaction score: > 4.0/5.0 (quarterly survey)

### 7.2 Business Metrics
- Time saved vs. previous method: > 2 hours/week per user
- Missed deadlines reduction: > 30% reduction in first 3 months
- Onboarding time: New team member productive within 30 minutes

### 7.3 Technical Metrics
- Page load time: < 2 seconds (Lighthouse performance > 80)
- API response time: < 500ms for p95
- Uptime: > 99.5% monthly
- Error rate: < 0.1% of requests

## 8. Technical Considerations

### 8.1 Affected Subsystems

**Primary (directly implemented):**
- **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**: Task UI components, state management, routing
- **Backend (Python/Flask)**: Task API endpoints, authentication, business logic
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Task schema, user schema, relationships, indexes

**Secondary (integrated with):**
- **Authentication System**: User roles and JWT session management
- **Email System**: Task assignment notifications (future)
- **File Storage**: Task attachments (future)

### 8.2 Integration Points
- Email service (SMTP or SendGrid) for notifications — Phase 3
- File storage (S3 or local) for attachments — Phase 3

### 8.3 Data Storage and Privacy
- All user data stored in PostgreSQL with encryption at rest
- No PII beyond email addresses and names
- GDPR-compliant data deletion on user request
- Daily automated backups, 30-day retention

### 8.4 Scalability and Performance
- Expected load: 2-10 concurrent users (small team scope)
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection pooling (pgbouncer)
- Frontend: React with code splitting for fast initial load
- Static assets: served via CDN

### 8.5 Potential Challenges
- Real-time task updates without WebSockets (polling or SSE in Phase 3)
- Mobile responsiveness on very small screens
- Search performance with large task backlogs (> 10,000 tasks)

- Core usable product (Phase 0-2): 6 weeks

### 9.2 Team Composition

- 1 Part-Time Frontend Reviewer
- 1 Part-Time PM (requirements, testing, acceptance)

### 9.3 Phase Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 0: Setup | 1 week | Project structure, CI/CD, database setup |
| Phase 1: Foundation | 2 weeks | Authentication, user management, base API |
| Phase 2: Core Features | 3 weeks | Task CRUD, assignment, status tracking, board view |
| Phase 3: Enhancement | 2 weeks | Search, filtering, reporting, accessibility |
