# Task 1: Setup Project Directory Structure

## Objective
Create the standard project directory structure following trent conventions, initialize the .trent/ task management system, and configure basic tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `src/` directory created with appropriate subdirectories
- [ ] `tests/` directory created with `unit/` and `integration/` subdirectories
- [ ] `docs/` directory created
- [ ] `.trent/` initialized with `TASKS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `SUBSYSTEMS.md`
- [ ] `README.md` created with project overview
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured for the project's tech stack
- [ ] `.env.example` created documenting required environment variables
- [ ] Virtual environment configured (UV for Python projects)

## Implementation Notes
- Follow trent file organization conventions
- Initialize git repository if not already done
- Create `.env.example` but never commit `.env`
- Use UV for Python virtual environment: `uv venv && uv sync`

## Testing Plan
1. Verify all required directories exist
2. Confirm `.trent/` structure is initialized correctly
3. Validate `.gitignore` excludes build artifacts, secrets, and venv
4. Confirm README describes the project accurately
