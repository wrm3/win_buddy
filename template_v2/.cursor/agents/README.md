# SubAgents User Guide

**Version**: 2.0 (Hybrid Architecture)
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-01
**Related**: [Task 052](../../.trent/tasks/task052_anthropic_agent_sdk_integration.md)

---

## 📋 Overview

This project includes a **hybrid SubAgents system** combining two powerful approaches:

1. **Agent SDK** (NEW) - Stateful, structured collaboration with context sharing
2. **Prompt-Based** (Existing) - Reliable, simple, text-based agents

**The system automatically chooses the best mode** for your task and falls back gracefully if needed.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using SubAgents (Automatic Mode)

**Just describe your task naturally** - the system handles the rest:

```
You: "Build a complete user authentication feature with database, API, and UI"

Claude automatically:
├─ Detects this needs multiple agents
├─ Creates shared context
├─ Coordinates: database-expert → backend-developer → frontend-developer
├─ Uses SDK mode (stateful coordination)
└─ Returns complete implementation
```

### Explicit Agent Invocation

**Manually specify which agent to use**:

```
You: "Use the backend-developer subagent to create a REST API for user management"
```

**Try the hybrid approach**:

```
You: "Use SDK agents to build the backend, then use prompt-based agents for documentation"
```

## 🎯 How to Use SDK Agents

### What are SDK Agents?

SDK agents are **stateful, context-aware** agents that:
- Share structured data (not just text)
- Remember past work in memory
- Invoke plugins (MCP tools)
- Coordinate seamlessly
- Work 5-10x faster on complex tasks

### When SDK Agents Activate

SDK agents automatically activate for:

✅ **Complex multi-agent workflows** (3+ agents)
```
"Build authentication across backend, frontend, and database"
```

✅ **Iterative development** (spans multiple sessions)
```
"Continue working on the payment integration we started yesterday"
```

✅ **Tasks needing memory**
```
"Use the same database preference as last time"
```

✅ **Plugin usage**
```
"Search for examples and implement the best approach"
```

### Checking If SDK is Active

Look for these indicators:

```
✓ SDK Mode Active
  ├─ Context shared between agents
  ├─ Memory enabled
  ├─ Plugins available
  └─ Structured handoffs
```

Or explicitly ask:

```
You: "Are we using SDK agents or prompt-based agents?"
```

---

## 📝 How to Use Prompt-Based Agents

### What are Prompt-Based Agents?

Prompt-based agents are **simple, reliable** agents that:
- Work with text messages
- Always available (no dependencies)
- Simple to understand
- Proven reliability
- Great for simple tasks

### When Prompt-Based Agents Activate

Automatically activate for:

✅ **Simple one-off tasks**
```
"Add docstrings to this file"
```

✅ **Single-agent work**
```
"Write a README for this project"
```

✅ **Quick experiments**
```
"Try refactoring this function"
```

✅ **Fallback scenarios**
```
"SDK agent failed, falling back to prompt-based..."
```

### Forcing Prompt-Based Mode

**Explicitly request prompt-based**:

```
You: "Use the prompt-based backend-developer agent (not SDK) to implement this"
```

---

## 🔄 Hybrid Mode Explained

### What is Hybrid Mode?

**Hybrid mode mixes both agent types** in the same workflow:

```
User: "Build a feature and document it"

Workflow:
├─ SDK agents: database-expert + backend-developer (complex coordination)
├─ Context passed via adapter (SDK → JSON)
└─ Prompt agent: technical-writer (simple documentation)

Result: Fast implementation + reliable documentation
```

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SDK Agent 1 (Backend)                          │
│  - Creates API endpoints                        │
│  - Stores in structured context                 │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼ (Context Adapter converts SDK → JSON)
               │
┌──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Prompt Agent 2 (Technical Writer)              │
│  - Reads JSON context file                      │
│  - Writes documentation                         │
│  - Returns text output                          │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼ (Context Adapter converts Text → SDK)
               │
┌──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┐
│  SDK Agent 3 (Frontend)                         │
│  - Sees both backend work + documentation       │
│  - Builds UI components                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Advantages

✅ **Best of both worlds**
- SDK speed for complex work
- Prompt reliability for simple tasks
- Automatic optimization

✅ **Graceful fallback**
- SDK fails → prompt-based takes over
- Never fully broken
- Always makes progress

✅ **Team flexibility**
- Different team members can use different modes
- Gradual learning curve
- Mix and match

## 🎬 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task (Prompt-Based)

```
You: "Add JSDoc comments to this function"

System: Uses prompt-based technical-writer
Why: Simple, one-file change
Result: Quick documentation, no overhead
```

### Example 2: Complex Feature (SDK)

```
You: "Build complete user authentication with:
- PostgreSQL database schema
- JWT token API
- React login/signup forms
- Password reset flow"

System: Uses SDK agents in sequence:
1. database-expert → creates schema
2. backend-developer → implements JWT APIs
3. frontend-developer → builds forms
4. test-runner → creates test suite

Why: Complex, multi-agent coordination
Result: 10x faster with context sharing
```

### Example 3: Hybrid Workflow

```
You: "Build a new feature and create documentation"

System:
1. SDK agents: database + backend + frontend (fast implementation)
2. Context adapter: converts SDK context → JSON
3. Prompt agent: technical-writer (reliable docs)

Why: Complex implementation + simple docs
Result: Best performance + best reliability
```

### Example 4: Parallel Execution (SDK)

```
You: "Implement 5 independent microservices"

System: Runs 5 backend-developers in parallel
Why: No dependencies between services
Result: 5x faster than sequential
```

### Example 5: Iterative Development (SDK Memory)

```
Session 1:
You: "Use PostgreSQL for the database"
System: Stores preference in memory

Session 2 (days later):
You: "Create a new API endpoint"
System: Remembers PostgreSQL preference, uses it automatically
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Agent didn't run"

**Problem**: Claude didn't delegate to subagent

**Solutions**:
1. Be explicit: "Use the backend-developer subagent to..."
2. Check agent exists: `.cursor/agents/{agent-name}.md`
3. Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
4. Try rephrasing request

### "SDK mode failed"

**Problem**: SDK agent threw error

**Expected behavior**: System automatically falls back to prompt-based

```
[INFO] SDK agent failed: timeout
[INFO] Falling back to prompt-based agent
[SUCCESS] Task completed using prompt-based mode
```

If fallback doesn't happen, report as bug.

### "Context not shared between agents"

**Problem**: Second agent doesn't see first agent's work

**Check**:
1. Are you in SDK mode? (should be automatic for multi-agent)
2. Is context being persisted? (check `.cursor/agent_context/`)
3. Try explicitly: "Make sure all agents share context"

### "Memory not working"

**Problem**: Agent doesn't remember preferences

**Check**:
1. Are you using SDK agents? (memory requires SDK mode)
2. Check memory files: `.cursor/memory/agent_decisions/`
3. Verify preference was stored: "Show me what the agent remembers"

### "Slow performance"

**Problem**: Workflow is slower than expected

**Check**:
1. Are you using SDK mode? (faster for multi-agent)
2. Try parallel execution: "Run these agents in parallel"
3. Check if context is too large (reduce shared data)

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Performance

✅ **Let the system choose mode**
- Don't force SDK or prompt-based unless needed
- System optimizes automatically

✅ **Be specific in requests**
- "Build user authentication" → system knows this needs multiple agents
- "Fix this typo" → system knows this is simple

✅ **Use memory effectively**
```
You: "Remember I prefer PostgreSQL and pytest"
Later: Agent automatically uses these preferences
```

✅ **Leverage parallel execution**
```
You: "These 3 tasks are independent, run them in parallel"
Result: 3x faster
```

### For Best Reliability

✅ **Trust the fallback**
- SDK fails → prompt-based activates
- Always makes progress

✅ **Verify important work**
```
You: "After building this feature, run tests and security audit"
Result: Automated verification
```

✅ **Check context sharing**
```
You: "Confirm the frontend agent can see the API endpoints"
```

### For Team Collaboration

✅ **Use consistent preferences**
```
You: "Store these project preferences in memory:
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Test framework: pytest
- Code style: black"
```

✅ **Document workflows**
```
You: "Document this multi-agent workflow for the team"
```

✅ **Mix modes if needed**
```
Experienced dev: "Use SDK agents for speed"
New dev: "Use prompt-based agents for simplicity"
Both approaches work!
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to choose between SDK and prompt-based?**
A: No! The system automatically chooses. Use hybrid mode and let it optimize.

**Q: What if SDK isn't available on my system?**
A: Everything falls back to prompt-based. You'll still get all functionality.

**Q: Can I force prompt-based mode?**
A: Yes, say "Use prompt-based agents only" or set `AGENT_SDK_MODE=prompt` in `.env`

**Q: How do I know which mode is active?**
A: Ask "Which agent mode are we using?" or check for context sharing indicators.

**Q: Will my existing prompts still work?**
A: Yes! All existing prompt-based agents are preserved and work exactly as before.

**Q: Can teams mix SDK and prompt-based?**
A: Yes! Different team members can use different modes. Context is shared either way.

**Q: Is one mode better than the other?**
A: Both have strengths. SDK is faster for complex work. Prompt is simpler and more reliable. Hybrid gives you both.

## 🎯 Summary

### Three Ways to Use SubAgents

1. **Automatic (Recommended)**
   ```
   Just describe your task naturally
   System chooses optimal mode
   ```

2. **Explicit Agent**
   ```
   "Use the backend-developer subagent..."
   System chooses SDK or prompt-based automatically
   ```

3. **Explicit Mode**
   ```
   "Use SDK agents for this complex workflow"
   "Use prompt-based agents for this simple task"
   ```

### Remember

- ✅ Hybrid mode gives best of both worlds
- ✅ Fallback ensures reliability
- ✅ Memory and plugins enhance SDK agents
- ✅ Prompt-based always works
- ✅ System optimizes automatically
