description: Use when creating, updating, completing, or querying tasks in .trent/. Activate for task CRUD operations, status changes, sync checks, task file creation, TASKS.md updates, phase completion gate, and pre-work file verification. Triggers on "create task", "update task", "complete task", "task status", "sync check", or any mention of task IDs.

# Trent Task Manager

You manage the `.trent/tasks/` system. You own TASKS.md and all task files.

## Core Rules

**Status flow**: `[ ]` → `[📋]` → `[🔄]` → `[✅]` — NEVER skip `[📋]`  
**Atomic updates**: TASKS.md and task file MUST update in the same response  
**File first**: Create task file BEFORE setting `[📋]` in TASKS.md  
**No self-verify**: You cannot mark your own implemented tasks `[✅]` — requires different agent

## Task File Naming
`taskNNN_descriptive_name.md` — NO underscore after "task", hyphens for subtasks (`task039-1_`)

## Phase ID Ranges
Phase 0: 1-99 | Phase 1: 100-199 | Phase N: N×100 to N×100+99

## Task File Format
```yaml
---
id: {id}
title: 'Task Title'
status: pending
priority: medium
phase: 0
subsystems: [affected_components]
project_context: 'Brief connection to project goal'
dependencies: []
blast_radius: low
requires_verification: false
ai_safe: true
spec_version: "1.0"
execution_cost: low
---
```

## Status Indicator Mapping
| TASKS.md | YAML status |
|---|---|
| `[ ]` | (no file yet) |
| `[📋]` | pending |
| `[🔄]` | in-progress |
| `[🔍]` | awaiting-verification |
| `[✅]` | completed |
| `[❌]` | failed |
| `[⏸️]` | paused |

## Pre-Work Verification (MANDATORY before coding)
```
□ Does .trent/tasks/task{ID}_*.md exist?
□ YAML has id, title, status, priority, phase?
□ TASKS.md shows [📋] or [🔄]?
→ BLOCKED if any NO — create file first
```

## Task Completion Workflow (5 Steps)
1. **Validate**: compile check, acceptance criteria met, no duplication introduced
2. **Atomic update**: set `status: completed` in file AND `[✅]` in TASKS.md
3. **Offer git commit**: `feat(subsystem): task title\n\nTask: #NNN\nPhase: N`
4. **Project files**: did this add MCP tools/commands/agents? → update AGENTS.md
5. **Confirm**: print sync confirmation footer

## Legacy YAML Upgrade
On first touch of any task missing `blast_radius`, `requires_verification`, `ai_safe`, `spec_version`, or `execution_cost`:
- Add defaults: `blast_radius: "low"`, `requires_verification: false`, `ai_safe: true`, `spec_version: "1.0"`, `execution_cost: low`, `tags: [legacy-upgraded]`
- Commit upgrade separately before claiming the task

## Sync Check Protocol
```
For each entry in TASKS.md:
  1. Active tasks: check .trent/tasks/task{id}_*.md
  2. [✅] tasks: also check .trent/phases/phase*/task{id}_*.md (archived)
  → Phantom = in TASKS.md but missing from BOTH locations
  → Orphan = file exists but not in TASKS.md
```

## Phase Completion Gate
When ALL tasks in a phase reach `[✅]`:
1. SWOT analysis (strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats)
2. WAIT for user "proceed" approval
3. Archive task files → `.trent/phases/phaseN/` (see trent-planner for archive protocol)
4. Git commit including archived files
5. `git tag phase-N-complete`

## Self-Check (End of Every Response)
```
□ Task file exists before marking [📋]?
□ Both TASKS.md and file updated atomically?
□ Git commit offered after completion?
□ Any error/warning mentioned → BUG entry in BUGS.md?
□ Any duplicated code → extract to lib/?
```
