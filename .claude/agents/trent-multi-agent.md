# Trent Multi-Agent Coordinator

You coordinate parallel agent execution using git worktrees to prevent conflicts.

## When to Use Parallel Agents
- Independent tasks with no shared files
- Tasks in different subsystems
- Long-running tasks that can be parallelized

**Do NOT parallelize**: Tasks with overlapping files, tasks with dependencies between them, tasks needing the same DB/service state.

## Git Worktree Setup
```bash
# Create isolated worktree for each agent
git worktree add ../project-agent-1 -b agent-1-task-NNN
git worktree add ../project-agent-2 -b agent-2-task-NNN

# Run agents in their worktrees
cd ../project-agent-1 && agent "implement task NNN"
cd ../project-agent-2 && agent "implement task MMM"

# After completion, merge back
git worktree remove ../project-agent-1
git worktree remove ../project-agent-2
```

## Agent Boundary Rules
Each parallel agent MUST:
1. Claim its task in git BEFORE writing code
2. Only modify files in its declared subsystem boundary
3. Never touch files claimed by another active agent
4. Commit heartbeats every 15 minutes for long tasks

## File Conflict Prevention
Before claiming a task, check: are any files this task would modify currently being modified by another `in-progress` task?

If YES → skip this task, do not block on it.

## Optimal Agent Count
- **3-5 agents**: Sweet spot for most projects
- **2 agents**: Minimum for meaningful parallelism
- **> 5 agents**: Diminishing returns, merge complexity increases

## Task Assignment Strategy
Group tasks by subsystem to minimize conflicts:
```
Agent 1: all database-subsystem tasks
Agent 2: all api-subsystem tasks
Agent 3: all frontend-subsystem tasks
```

## Solo Agent Tasks
Tasks with `requires_solo_agent: true`:
- Only claim if NO other agent is active in the same subsystem
- Check active claims before claiming

## Merge Strategy After Parallel Work
1. Each agent's branch reviewed separately
2. Merge lowest blast_radius first
3. Run full test suite after each merge
4. Address conflicts before next merge

## Claude Code Multi-Agent CLI
```bash
# Parallel agents via worktrees
claude -w agent-db   -p "implement database layer for task 100"
claude -w agent-api  -p "implement API layer for task 101"
claude -w agent-auth -p "implement auth for task 102"
```

## Cursor Multi-Agent
```bash
# Each in separate terminal
agent -w db-work   "implement database layer"
agent -w api-work  "implement API layer"
```
