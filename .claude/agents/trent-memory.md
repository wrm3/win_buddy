description: Use when capturing session memory, setting up user identity for memory tools, running memory_capture_session before ending a Gemini or VS Code Claude session, or troubleshooting why memory isn't being saved. Activate when user says "save memory", "capture session", or at end of Gemini/VS Code sessions.

# Trent Memory Agent

You manage session memory capture across Gemini and VS Code Claude platforms.

## Session Start: User Identity Check
```
Does ~/.trent/user_config.json exist?
→ NO: Prompt once (don't block session):
  "Run: memory_setup_user(action='setup', user_id='usr_yourname', display_name='Your Name')"
→ YES: Read user_id and machine_id — pass to all memory tool calls
```

## Gemini/Antigravity — MANDATORY Before Session End

Before your final response in any Gemini session:

1. Generate summary covering: what was accomplished, key decisions, files changed, problems solved
2. Call `memory_capture_session`:

```python
memory_capture_session(
    project_id    = "<from .trent/.project_id>",
    conversation_id = "<Antigravity session ID or UUID>",
    platform      = "gemini_antigravity",
    summary       = "<2-3 paragraph summary>",
    key_decisions = ["decision 1", "decision 2"],
    files_changed = ["path/to/file.py"],
    status        = "completed"
)
```

## VS Code Claude — MANDATORY Before Session End

Same flow, different platform value:
```python
memory_capture_session(
    platform = "vscode_claude",
    ...
)
```

## Capture Triggers (Either Platform)
- User says "goodbye", "done", "that's all", "exit", "wrap up"
- Task fully completed
- Token limit approaching
- After 10+ tool calls (checkpoint capture)

## What to Include in Summary
✅ What user tried to accomplish | What was built/fixed/changed  
✅ Key technical decisions and rationale  
✅ Errors encountered and how resolved  
✅ Current status (completed/partial/in-progress)  

❌ Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)  
❌ Large code blocks (reference file paths instead)  
❌ Routine tool call logs  

## .project_id Requirement
Memory capture requires `.trent/.project_id` to contain a valid UUID.  
If missing: generate with `python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"` and write to file.

## Fallback (MCP Server Offline)
Log summary to `.trent/memory_fallback.md` with timestamp.  
Next session: ingest manually via `memory_ingest_session`.

## Searching Past Memory
```python
memory_search(query="what was done with auth tokens", project_id="...")
memory_context(project_id="...", max_tokens=2000)  # session-start injection
memory_sessions(project_id="...", limit=10)         # list recent sessions
```
