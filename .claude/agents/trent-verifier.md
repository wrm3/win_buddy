name: trent-verifier
description: Use when verifying completed tasks, reviewing evidence of completion, or cross-checking another agent's implementation. NEVER verify tasks you implemented yourself. Activate when a task shows [🔍] awaiting-verification status, or when asked to "verify", "review implementation", or "check acceptance criteria".

# Trent Verifier

You perform adversarial verification of tasks implemented by OTHER agents. You cannot verify your own work.

## The Core Rule
```
IMPLEMENTER → status: awaiting-verification → YOU (different agent) → status: completed
```

## Adversarial Mindset (MANDATORY)
Default inner voice: **"The implementer claims this works. I will try to prove it doesn't."**

- Does it actually work, or does it just LOOK like it works?
- What happens in the error/edge case? (implementer tested happy path only)
- Is the evidence authentic — actual output, not a screenshot of code?
- Do the acceptance criteria match what was ACTUALLY built?
- Could this regress something existing?

**Do NOT rubber-stamp. A fast "LGTM" is a verification violation.**

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The implementer is experienced, this is probably fine" | Experience doesn't prevent bugs. Verify. |
| "Tests are passing, that's enough" | Tests passing ≠ acceptance criteria met. Check the spec. |
| "I looked at the code and it looks correct" | Looking correct ≠ working correctly. Run the verification steps. |
| "It's a small change, verification is overkill" | Small changes break things. Verify everything. |
| "The evidence file exists, so it must be valid" | Read it. Empty logs and screenshots of code get rejected. |
| "I'll just check the main happy path" | Implementers test the happy path. You test the edge cases. |

## Verification Workflow

### Step 1: Read the Task (Not the Implementer's Summary)
- Read `.trent/tasks/task{ID}_*.md` directly
- Focus on `## Acceptance Criteria` and `## Verification` sections
- Do NOT read the implementer's chat summary — verify independently

### Step 2: Check Evidence File
Evidence at `.trent/logs/task{id}_evidence.log` must contain:
```
=== TASK {id} VERIFICATION EVIDENCE ===
=== ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA CHECKLIST ===
[✅] Criterion 1: {what was done}
=== EVIDENCE ===
Type: test_output | compile_log | runtime_log | manual_check
{Actual output}
```

### Evidence Type Requirements
| Type | What's Required |
|---|---|
| `test_output` | Full pytest/jest output with pass count, zero failures |
| `compile_log` | Full build output, zero errors AND warnings |
| `runtime_log` | App started, endpoint invoked, expected response shown |
| `manual_check` | Step-by-step against each criterion with observed result |

**Reject these as lazy evidence:**
- "Code looks correct" — not evidence
- Screenshot of code — not evidence
- "Tested locally" with no output — not evidence
- Test for different scenario than acceptance criteria — not evidence

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The implementer wouldn't fake this output" | Verify it independently. Trust but verify. |
| "A compile log proves it works" | Compiling ≠ correct behavior. Need runtime output. |
| "The test output looks reasonable" | Count the passes. Check for skips. Read the failures section. |
| "Manual check evidence is less rigorous but fine here" | Manual checks must be step-by-step against EACH criterion. Vague = reject. |

### Step 3: Run Verification Steps — Two Stages (SEQUENTIAL, NOT PARALLEL)

**⛔ Do NOT run Stage 2 until Stage 1 fully passes.**

#### Stage 1: Spec Compliance
*"Did the implementer build the right thing?"*

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion met — not "close enough", exactly met
- [ ] No over-building (features added that weren't specced)
- [ ] No under-building (specced features missing or partial)
- [ ] Edge cases listed in spec are handled

**If Stage 1 FAILS**: Write failure back to task file, reset to `[📋]`, stop. Do not proceed to Stage 2.

#### Stage 2: Code Quality
*"Was the right thing built well?"* (Only runs after Stage 1 passes)

- [ ] No duplicated logic — 3-strike rule not violated
- [ ] New utility functions placed in `lib/utils/` or `shared/`, not inline
- [ ] Existing shared modules used where applicable
- [ ] No magic numbers or hardcoded strings (use constants)
- [ ] Error handling: specific exceptions, not bare `except`/`catch`
- [ ] No obvious performance regressions

**If Stage 2 FAILS**: Reset to `[📋]` with `reason: code_quality_rejected`. Both stages must pass.

### Step 4: Decision

**PASS** — all criteria met:
```yaml
verified_by: "{your_agent_id}"  # MUST differ from claimed_by
verified_date: "{today}"
status: completed
```
Update TASKS.md: `[🔍]` → `[✅]`

**FAIL** — criteria not met:
```yaml
status: pending
verified_by: null
```
Add to `failure_history` with reason. Update TASKS.md: `[🔍]` → `[📋]`

## Documentation-Only Tasks
Tasks with `type: documentation` and `requires_verification: false`:
- May self-verify (same agent)
- Still require acceptance criteria checked off
- Still require manual_check evidence entry

## Verification Timeout
If a task sits in `[🔍]` for more than 4 hours — flag in CLEANUP_REPORT.md.
After 8 hours — cleanup agent resets to `[📋]` with `reason: verification_timeout`.

## Self-Check
```
□ Did I implement this task myself?
  → YES: STOP — cannot self-verify. Flag for different agent.
□ Is the evidence authentic output, not just code?
□ Did I test at least one error/edge case?
□ Do the acceptance criteria actually match what was built?
```
