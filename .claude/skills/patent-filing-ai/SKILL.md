## Patent Claims Drafting

### Understanding Claims

**Claims define the legal boundaries of your patent** - they determine what you can enforce.

**Structure**:
```
Independent Claim (broadest)
  ├─ Dependent Claim 1 (adds feature A)
  ├─ Dependent Claim 2 (adds feature B)
  └─ Dependent Claim 3 (adds features A + C)
```

### Types of Claims

#### System Claims
Describe the invention as a system/apparatus

**Example**:
```
Claim 1: A neural network system for processing sequential data, comprising:
  a) an input layer configured to receive a sequence of tokens;
  b) a plurality of attention layers, each attention layer including:
     i) a hierarchical clustering module configured to group tokens based on semantic similarity;
     ii) an intra-cluster attention module configured to compute attention within clusters;
     iii) an inter-cluster attention module configured to compute attention between cluster representatives;
  c) an output layer configured to generate predictions based on processed representations.
```

#### Method Claims
Describe the invention as a process/steps

**Example**:
```
Claim 1: A computer-implemented method for training a neural network, comprising:
  a) receiving training data comprising input-output pairs;
  b) processing input sequences through a hierarchical attention mechanism, wherein the hierarchical attention mechanism:
     i) groups input tokens into semantic clusters;
     ii) computes within-cluster attention scores;
     iii) computes between-cluster attention scores;
  c) computing a loss function based on predicted and actual outputs;
  d) updating network parameters using gradient descent;
  e) repeating steps a-d until convergence criteria are met.
```

#### Computer-Readable Medium Claims
Describe invention as software

**Example**:
```
Claim 1: A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising:
  a) receiving an input sequence of tokens;
  b) applying a hierarchical attention mechanism to the input sequence;
  c) generating an output prediction based on processed representations.
```

### Claim Drafting Strategy

#### Independent Claims (Broad)
- Cover core invention
- Fewer limitations = broader protection
- Must be novel and non-obvious
- Multiple independent claims for different aspects

#### Dependent Claims (Narrow)
- Add specific features to independent claims
- Provide fallback protection
- Cover specific implementations
- Easier to defend if independent claim fails

### Example Claim Set

**For AI/ML Training Method**:

```
Claim 1 (Independent): A method for training a machine learning model...
Claim 2 (Dependent on 1): The method of claim 1, wherein the model is a transformer architecture...
Claim 3 (Dependent on 1): The method of claim 1, wherein the training data comprises at least 1 billion tokens...
Claim 4 (Dependent on 2): The method of claim 2, wherein the transformer includes a modified attention mechanism...
Claim 5 (Independent): A system for implementing the method of claim 1...
Claim 6 (Dependent on 5): The system of claim 5, wherein the system includes at least 8 GPUs...
```

### Common Claim Mistakes

❌ **Too Broad**:
"A system for using AI" → Unpatentable abstract idea

✅ **Appropriately Scoped**:
"A neural network system comprising [specific technical details]"

❌ **Too Narrow**:
"A system using PyTorch framework with CUDA 11.8 on NVIDIA A100 GPUs"

✅ **Better**:
"A distributed training system using parallel computing resources"

❌ **Functional Language Without Structure**:
"A system that improves accuracy"

✅ **Better**:
"A system comprising [specific components] configured to [specific operations]"

## International Patents (PCT)

### When to Consider International Patents

**File internationally if**:
- Market opportunity exists outside US
- Competitors are global
- Manufacturing will be offshore
- Seeking international investors
- Long-term licensing strategy

**Skip international if**:
- Limited to US market
- Cost-prohibitive ($50K+ for multiple countries)
- Invention has short commercial lifecycle
- Targeting acquisition (buyer will handle IP)

### PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty)

**What is PCT?**
- International patent application
- Single filing covers 150+ countries
- Delays national phase decisions by 18-30 months
- Allows time to assess market potential

**Timeline**:
```
Month 0: File US provisional patent
Month 12: File PCT application (or US utility)
Month 30-42: Enter national phase in selected countries
Years 2-5: National examination and grants
```

### PCT Process

#### Step 1: File PCT Application
- Must file within 12 months of provisional
- Cost: $4,000-$6,000 (fees + attorney)
- Use WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization)

#### Step 2: International Search Report (ISR)
- Examiner searches prior art
- Provides opinion on patentability
- Helps decide which countries to enter

#### Step 3: National Phase Entry
- Select countries to pursue (30-42 months after priority date)
- File in each country
- Pay national fees
- Hire local attorneys (required)

#### Step 4: National Examination
- Each country examines independently
- Different standards and timelines
- May grant in some countries, reject in others

### Costs by Region

**Europe (EPO)**:
- Filing: $10,000-$20,000
- Validation in 3-5 countries: $15,000-$30,000
- Total: $25,000-$50,000

**China**:
- Filing and prosecution: $10,000-$15,000
- Important for manufacturing

**Japan**:
- Filing and prosecution: $10,000-$15,000
- Important for tech market

**Other countries**: $5,000-$10,000 each

**Total for US + PCT + 5 countries**: $75,000-$150,000

### Strategy for Startups

**Year 1**:
- File provisional patent (US): $130

**Year 1-2**:
- File utility patent (US): $10,000-$30,000
- Optionally file PCT: +$4,000-$6,000

**Year 2-3**:
- Evaluate market traction
- If successful: Enter national phase in key countries
- If not: Let PCT lapse, keep US patent

**Benefit**: Delays expensive international decisions until you know if product succeeds.

### Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **DIY Provisional**: File yourself ($130)
2. **Hire Attorney Later**: For utility patent only
3. **Delay International**: File PCT to buy time, enter national phase only if successful
4. **Micro Entity Status**: Cuts fees by 75%
5. **Limited Countries**: Only file in key markets (US + 1-2 others)

## FAQs

### Q: Can I file a patent after publishing my research?
**A**: In the US, you have a 1-year grace period after public disclosure. **Internationally, NO grace period** - must file before any public disclosure. **Best practice**: File provisional patent BEFORE publishing.

### Q: How much technical detail should I include?
**A**: As much as possible! More detail = better protection. Include:
- Architecture diagrams
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Mathematical formulations
- Example implementations
- Test results showing advantages

### Q: What if someone else files a patent on the same idea?
**A**: **First to file wins** in the US. This is why filing provisional patent quickly is CRITICAL. Your filing date is your priority date.

### Q: Can I file a patent on a model I trained using someone else's architecture?
**A**: Generally no, unless you've made novel modifications to the architecture or training method. Training a standard BERT model on your dataset is not patentable.

### Q: Do I need a lawyer for provisional patent?
**A**: No, most inventors file provisional patents themselves. It's simpler and just establishes your priority date. **Utility patent**: Lawyer highly recommended.

### Q: How long does the patent process take?
**A**:
- Provisional filing: 1 day
- Utility patent examination: 1-3 years
- Total from provisional to granted patent: 3-4 years average

### Q: What happens if I don't file utility patent within 12 months?
**A**: Your provisional patent expires and you lose your priority date. You can still file a new provisional or utility patent, but competitors might have filed in the meantime.

### Q: Can I update my provisional patent?
**A**: No, provisional patents cannot be amended. But you can file a **continuation-in-part (CIP)** application that adds new material while maintaining priority for original material.

### Q: How do I know if my invention is patentable?
**A**: Use the prior art search tools in this skill. If you can't find prior art that discloses your invention, it's likely patentable. Patent attorney can provide definitive opinion.
