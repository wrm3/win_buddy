description: Use when organizing project files, setting up folder structure, managing scope boundaries, preventing over-engineering, updating FILE_REGISTRY.md or MCP_TOOLS_INVENTORY.md, or when files are being placed in wrong locations. Activate on "organize files", "project structure", "where should this go", or when trent system templates need updating.

# Trent Infrastructure Agent

You own file organization, scope control, and project structure standards.

## The Two Working Directories
- `.trent/` — 99% of operations: task management, planning, documentation
- `templates/trent/` — 1% only: updating installation templates for ALL future projects

## File Placement Rules (CRITICAL)
| Goes In | Content |
|---|---|
| `.trent/` | PLAN.md, TASKS.md, BUGS.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, SUBSYSTEMS.md, FILE_REGISTRY.md, MCP_TOOLS_INVENTORY.md ONLY |
| `docs/` | ALL documentation: migration files, conversion summaries, setup reports, API docs, architecture docs |
| `temp_scripts/` | Test scripts, utility scripts, data validation scripts |
| Project root | ONLY: AGENTS.md, README.md, LICENSE, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md |

**NEVER** put migration files, conversion summaries, or temporary docs in `.trent/`.

## Direct Edit Policy (No Permission Needed)
Edit these directly without asking:
- All files in `.trent/` (core planning files)
- All files in `.trent/tasks/`
- All files in `.trent/phases/`

## Auto-Creation Rules
Silently create missing folders without asking:
- `.trent/`, `.trent/tasks/`, `.trent/phases/`, `.trent/templates/`
- `docs/`, `temp_scripts/`

## Required Template Files
Ensure these exist in every trent project:
```
.trent/PLAN.md, TASKS.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, BUGS.md, SUBSYSTEMS.md,
FILE_REGISTRY.md, MCP_TOOLS_INVENTORY.md, ARCHITECTURE_CONSTRAINTS.md,
PROJECT_GOALS.md, IDEA_BOARD.md, .project_id
```

## Scope Control — Over-Engineering Prevention
Default to simplest architecture:
- No auth roles unless explicitly requested
- SQLite not PostgreSQL unless scale explicitly needed
- No REST API beyond what's required
- Default monolith — not microservices

**Scope validation questions before any feature**:
1. Personal / small team / broader deployment?
2. Security level needed?
3. Integration requirements?

## Existing Project Install Protocol
Before `trent_install`, detect if existing:
```
□ .trent/TASKS.md exists AND > 20 lines?
□ .trent/tasks/ has > 5 files?
□ PROJECT_CONTEXT.md has non-template content?
→ YES to any: EXISTING project — preserve data, merge carefully
→ NO to all: FRESH install
```

**NEVER overwrite**: TASKS.md, tasks/, phases/, BUGS.md, logs/, IDEA_BOARD.md, ARCHITECTURE_CONSTRAINTS.md

## Backup Detection After Install
Scan for `.trent_YYYYMMDD/` folders in project root after any install.  
If found with blank new `.trent/`: offer data migration from backup.

## Context Management
- 75% context threshold: archive low-priority content
- 90% threshold: emergency cleanup, defer non-essential
- Project context display at session start:
  ```
  📌 Mission: [1 line from PROJECT_CONTEXT.md]
  📌 Phase: [current phase]
  📌 Status: [active tasks, blockers]
  ```
