## Phase Management

### Phase Document Structure
**Location**: `.trent/phases/phase{N}_{kebab-case-name}.md` (e.g., `phase0_setup.md`, `phase1_foundation.md`)

**Template**:
```markdown
# Phase N: [Phase Name]

## Overview
[Brief description of the phase objectives]

## Task ID Range
- Start: N×100 (or 1 for Phase 0)
- End: N×100+99 (or 99 for Phase 0)

## Objectives
- [Objective 1]
- [Objective 2]

## Deliverables
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

## Technical Considerations
- **Subsystems**: [List affected subsystems]
- **Dependencies**: [List phase dependencies]
- **Prerequisites**: [Prior phases that must complete]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]

## Related Tasks
- Links to tasks in TASKS.md that implement this phase
```

### Phase Naming Convention
- Format: `phase{N}_{kebab-case-name}.md`
- Examples: `phase0_setup.md`, `phase1_foundation.md`, `phase2_core-development.md`
- Include phase number prefix with underscore separator
- Use hyphens within the name portion for multi-word names

### Phase-Task Integration
- Tasks reference phases via `phase:` field in YAML
- Phase documents list implementing tasks
- Phase completion tracked through task completion

## Scope Validation

### Mandatory Questions (Ask Before Creating PRD)

**Purpose**: Prevent over-engineering and clarify requirements

#### 1. User Context & Deployment
"Intended for personal use, small team, or broader deployment?"
- **Personal (1 user)**: Simple, file-based, minimal security
- **Small team (2-10)**: Basic sharing, simple user management
- **Broader (10+)**: Full authentication, role management, scalability

#### 2. Security Requirements
"Security expectations?"
- **Minimal**: Basic validation, no authentication
- **Standard**: User auth, session management, basic authorization
- **Enhanced**: Role-based access, encryption, audit trails
- **Enterprise**: SAML/SSO, compliance, advanced security

#### 3. Scalability Expectations
"Performance and scalability expectations?"
- **Basic**: Works for expected load, simple architecture
- **Moderate**: Handles growth, some optimization
- **High**: Speed-optimized, caching, efficient queries
- **Enterprise**: Load balancing, clustering, horizontal scaling

#### 4. Feature Complexity
"How much complexity comfortable with?"
- **Minimal**: Core functionality, keep simple
- **Standard**: Core plus reasonable conveniences
- **Feature-Rich**: Comprehensive with advanced options
- **Enterprise**: Full-featured with extensive configuration

#### 5. Integration Requirements
"Integration needs?"
- **Standalone**: No external integrations
- **Basic**: File import/export, basic API
- **Standard**: REST API, webhooks, common integrations
- **Enterprise**: Comprehensive API, message queues, enterprise systems

### Over-Engineering Prevention Rules

**Apply these defaults unless explicitly requested:**
- **Authentication**: Don't add role permissions unless requested
- **Database**: Use simple file-based unless DB explicitly requested
- **API**: Don't add comprehensive REST beyond required
- **Architecture**: Default monolith unless scale requires separation

## Codebase Analysis (Existing Projects)

### When to Use
When initializing trent in existing projects with code

### Analysis Process

1. **File Structure Analysis**
   - Identify main components and modules
   - Determine project organization patterns
   - Map directory structure to functionality

2. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Map relationships between components
   - Identify external dependencies
   - Document integration points

3. **Phase Extraction**
   - Identify phases from code patterns
   - Determine phase boundaries
   - Group related functionality

4. **Subsystem Identification**
   - Group related functionality into subsystems
   - Define subsystem boundaries
   - Document subsystem responsibilities

5. **Integration Discovery**
   - Find external system connections
   - Identify APIs and services used
   - Document data flows

### Analysis Outputs
- Generate PLAN.md based on current code structure
- Create phase documents for each major milestone
- Identify subsystems from code organization
- Document current architecture and integration points

## Planning Operations
