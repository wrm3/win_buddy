# Quality Metrics Guide

## Overview

This guide defines quality metrics for tracking bug patterns, resolution performance, and overall system quality in the trent QA system.

## Bug Metrics

### Bug Discovery Rate
**Definition**: Number of bugs found per development cycle

**Formula**: `Bugs Found / Time Period`

**Targets:**
- Development: 5-10 bugs per sprint (good - catching early)
- Testing: 2-5 bugs per sprint (acceptable)
- Production: <1 bug per sprint (goal)

**Interpretation:**
- High in development: Good (catching early)
- High in testing: Concerning (development quality)
- High in production: Critical (quality issues)

**Example:**
```
Sprint 1: 8 bugs found in development, 3 in testing, 0 in production
Sprint 2: 6 bugs found in development, 2 in testing, 1 in production

Analysis: Sprint 1 better - caught more early, none reached production
```

### Bug Resolution Time
**Definition**: Average time from discovery to resolution

**Formula**: `Sum(Resolution Time) / Number of Bugs`

**Targets:**
- Critical: <24 hours
- High: 1-3 days
- Medium: 3-7 days
- Low: <30 days

**Calculation:**
```
Bug 001: Opened 10/15, Closed 10/15 = 0 days (Critical)
Bug 002: Opened 10/16, Closed 10/18 = 2 days (High)
Bug 003: Opened 10/17, Closed 10/22 = 5 days (Medium)

Average: (0 + 2 + 5) / 3 = 2.3 days
```

**Interpretation:**
- Decreasing trend: Improving process
- Increasing trend: Quality or capacity issues
- Spikes: Complex bugs or resource constraints

### Bug Severity Distribution
**Definition**: Breakdown of bugs by severity level

**Formula**: `(Bugs at Severity / Total Bugs) * 100%`

**Healthy Distribution:**
- Critical: <5%
- High: 10-20%
- Medium: 30-40%
- Low: 40-60%

**Example:**
```
Total Bugs: 50
Critical: 2 (4%)
High: 8 (16%)
Medium: 18 (36%)
Low: 22 (44%)

Analysis: Healthy distribution, most bugs are low severity
```

**Red Flags:**
- Critical >10%: Serious quality issues
- High >30%: Development quality problems
- Low <20%: May be under-reporting minor issues

### Feature Impact Analysis
**Definition**: Which features are most affected by bugs

**Calculation:**
```
Feature A: 12 bugs
Feature B: 8 bugs
Feature C: 3 bugs
Feature D: 2 bugs

Analysis: Feature A needs attention (48% of bugs)
```

**Actions:**
- High bug count: Code review, refactoring, additional testing
- Consistent issues: Architecture problems
- Sudden spike: Recent changes introduced issues

### Regression Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of fixes that introduce new bugs

**Formula**: `(Bugs Caused by Fixes / Total Fixes) * 100%`

**Target**: <5%

**Example:**
```
10 bugs fixed in sprint
1 fix introduced new bug

Regression Rate: (1/10) * 100% = 10%

Analysis: Above target, need better testing
```

**Mitigation:**
- Improve test coverage
- Better code review
- Automated regression testing
- Staged rollouts

## Quality Workflows

### Bug Triage Workflow
**Frequency**: Daily for critical/high, weekly for medium/low

**Process:**
1. Review new bugs
2. Assign severity
3. Assign to developer
4. Set priority
5. Estimate effort

**Metrics:**
- Triage time: <24 hours
- Accuracy: >90% correct severity

### Bug Resolution Workflow
**Process:**
1. Investigate (status: Investigating)
2. Fix (status: Fixing)
3. Test (status: Testing)
4. Deploy (status: Closed)

**Metrics:**
- Time in each status
- Bottlenecks identified
- Resolution velocity

### Quality Review Workflow
**Frequency**: Weekly

**Process:**
1. Review bug metrics
2. Identify patterns
3. Address high-impact areas
